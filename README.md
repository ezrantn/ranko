# Ranko

## Introduction

Information retrieval has new difficulties as a result of the web. Both the volume of material on the internet and the number of new users who are not skilled in web research are expanding quickly. Human-maintained, high-quality indices like [Yahoo!](http://www.yahoo.com/) or search engines are frequently the first places people go while browsing the web due to its link graph.

Here I present a mini search engine called *Ranko*. It is built using Go and provides a user-friendly interface, thanks to Templ and DaisyUI. The mechanics of *Ranko* are based on the [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) algorithm used by Google Search. However, the catch is that *Ranko* doesn't scale like Google, as I tried to keep it simple. This is my project that I built out of curiosity about "How do search engines work?"
